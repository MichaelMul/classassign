### 📚 What we learned
We learned how to build a simple PHP web app, use forms, manage data in sessions, and design a user interface with Bootstrap. This exercise helped us understand the basics of CRUD and teamwork in web development.

### 📚 Why did we build this?
This is our first hands-on project for Mrs. Laura's Web Development class. We learned the basics of PHP, forms, CRUD, and how web apps work—one step at a time!

### 💡 How to run it
1. Copy the `classassign` folder to your `htdocs` (if not already there).
2. Start XAMPP/Apache.
3. Open [http://localhost/classassign/](http://localhost/classassign/) in your browser.

### 🎈 Have fun!
We hope you enjoy using (and grading!) our project.
